I am an optimistic person who can handle tough situations with a positive attitude 
I got my Master's degree from St. Joseph's College(2019-2021) and my Bachelor's degree(2016-2019) in the same college too

I wish to impart my knowledge in testing the applications at the same time i want to learn more in the testing field to enrich myself with new concepts
