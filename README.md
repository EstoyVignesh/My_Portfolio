About me, I am an optimistic person who can handle tough situations without any trouble
I got my Master's degree from St. Joseph's College(2019-2021) and my Bachelor's degree(2016-2019) in the same college too
For 2 years, I struggled to choose a path. Later I found my passion in Software testing and thus I decided to walk in that path. So I joined Java Automation Course in Guvi and have learned many things and done projects in the testing field Now, 
I wish to impart my knowledge in testing the applications at the same time i want to learn more in the testing field to enrich myself with new concepts
If given the opportunity i would like to showcase my abilities and knowledge
