About me
I am a optimistic person who can handle tough situations withot any trouble.

I got my Master's degree from St. Joseph's College(2019-2021) and my Bachelor's degree(2016-2019) in the same college too.

For 2 years I struggled to choose a pat. And later I found my passion in Software testing and thus I decided to walk in that path. So I joined Java Automation Course in Guvi and have learned many thing and done projects in the testing field.
Now, I wish to impart my knowledge in testing the applications at the same time i want to learn more in the testing field to enrich myself with new concepts.

If given the opportunity i would like to showcase my abilities and knowledge
