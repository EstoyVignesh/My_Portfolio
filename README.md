#  About Me:

I am an optimistic person who can handle tough situations with a positive attitude <br>
I got my Master's degree from St. Joseph's College(2019-2021) and my Bachelor's degree(2016-2019) also in St. Joseph's <br>
For 2 years, I struggled to choose a path. Later I found my passion in Software testing and thus I decided to walk in that path. So I joined the Java Automation Course in Guvi and have learned many things and done projects in the testing field <br> 
Now, I wish to impart my knowledge in testing the applications at the same time I want to learn more in the testing field to enrich myself with new concepts<br>
If given the opportunity I would like to showcase my abilities and knowledge
